## A completely open-source Discord bot project
**Switchblade** is an open-source multi purpose Discord bot, built for those who want structure quality, fine command organization, user enjoyability and ease of access when it comes to host it by yourself. Switchblade isn't supposed to be your average Discord bot. The objective of the project is to create a bot that does as many things as possible (just like an actual switchblade), and it also brings a new whole world of modularity and personal configuration, so that you can equip it with your favorite tools.

## How to install
First of all, clone the GitHub repository to your local drive and navigate to its folder with
```shell
git clone https://github.com/SwitchbladeBot/switchblade && cd switchblade
```
*(Ensure that you have [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads), [Node.js with npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [Windows Build Tools](https://www.npmjs.com/package/windows-build-tools) installed before doing anything)*

After that, execute ```npm install```.

If you're running a production instance or a normal instance, make sure to read [this](https://github.com/SwitchbladeBot/switchblade/wiki/Environment-Variables) so that you can get to know what you will need to run a Switchblade local instance.
After you've checked them, if you're running a local instance, add those environment variables within a .env file. Example:
```
DISCORD_TOKEN=MjEwOTE2ODc1OTg3MTQ0NjA5.lFE3aA.CQiNp7rRa9VaXZEcpTRYReDo8UP
PREFIX=s!
```
Then, run ```npm run start-dev```

If you're running it on Heroku, just add [those same environment variables](https://github.com/SwitchbladeBot/switchblade/wiki/Environment-Variables) within the *Config Vars* section on the settings of your Heroku project ![Heroku Config Vars](http://i.join-my.stream/anBu07W.png)

Then, disable the *web* dyno within *Resources*, enable the *worker* dyno, and you're pretty much done! ![Heroku Resources](http://i.join-my.stream/ld8SQbi.png)
